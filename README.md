# Purpose
I'm developing a private self-hosted application to manage my Etsy shop listings. This tool is built independently and is NOT affiliated with or directed by any third-party platform. The application runs on my own infrastructure. It does NOT share data externally, and no third-party service is involved in its operation or distribution. The API key will be used solely by me (developer & shop owner) to manage my own shop. The application is NOT intended for resale, redistribution, or use by others.

# Privacy Policy

This app does not collect, store, or share any personal data from Etsy users. 

All Etsy API interactions are limited to managing listings only on my own Etsy shop (https://www.etsy.com/shop/EpicccAttire) (such as managing prices and mockups).

I do not access, store, or distribute any third-party Etsy data. No user credentials are collected or used.

This app is operated solely by me, and I am committed to maintaining privacy and data protection standards.
